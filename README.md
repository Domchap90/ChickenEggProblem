# ChickenEggProblem

An exam question i received from Test Dome. It gave me the starting code of a Bird Interface, a Chicken and an Egg class. From there the goal was to complete the interface along with the classes in order for the main code to run.

The following criteria had to be met:

- A Bird lays an egg of the same type as the Bird in question (here a chicken).
- A bird can lay an egg, then the egg can hatch only once.
- If a second attempt is made to hatch the same egg object then an Exception will be thrown.

Allow the code to run and compile successfully whilst adhering to these conditions.
